# 5v5-team-mixer

## Main Information

Coded this application using VS 2017 and BunifuUI (cracked due to monetary reasons).  
Made it because my group of friends would always have trouble picking the teams when playing some game that involved 10 players.  

## Features

1. Real time information about everything being done in the application (status and warnings).  
2. Counter for the amount of times the teams have been mixed.

Pardon my spaghetti code for I did not know how to code (and still don't).
